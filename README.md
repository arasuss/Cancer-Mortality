# Cancer-Mortality
Dataset : https://data.world/exercises/linear-regression-exercise-1/workspace/file?filename=cancer_reg.csv

The primary goal of the study is to use multi-linear regression to forecast the target death rate. The dataset was obtained from data.world, and I've provided a link here as well. There are 33 features and 3047 instances in this dataset. Here, I do EDA and fit it into the work that has been done with linear, multilinear, and ANN.
